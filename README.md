Exercise 1: Implement a secure two-party protocol for the blood type compatibility function using the one-time truth table protocol. Since the goal of the exercise is to better understand the protocol (not to build a full functioning system), feel free to implement all parties on the same machine and without using network communication.

Code exists in assignment2/ott.py
To test, change blood type of bob and alice at the start of the main function(line 76 and 77)

requirements: python, no extra packages
